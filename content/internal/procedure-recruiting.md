## References
Always follow up on references. You should approach any references which are nominated by the candidate. But it also makes sense to try and find some independent (and possibly more impartial) references at previous employers.

Since everybody is busy, an approach to getting feedback from a reference would be to simply send them a polite email asking them to rate the person on a scale of 1 to 10.

        <h2>Training Philosophy</h2>

        <p>Our training emphasises practical skills. So, although you'll be learning concepts and theory, you'll see how everything is applied in the real world. We will work through examples and exercises based on real datasets.</p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <p>All you'll need is a computer with a browser and a decent internet connection. We'll be using an online development environment. This means that we can focus on learning and not on solving technical problems.</p>

        <p>Of course, we are happy to help you get your local environment set up too! You can start by following <a href="/blog/setup-general/">these instructions</a>.
